## Short Description

The core idea of this game is to get as further as possible, avoiding both the enemies and the 
projectiles and shooting your way out. For this small project, I implemented three types of ene
mies that have different behaviors (non-shooting, shooting with one projectile at a time and 
shooting with 3 projectiles at the same time). Each new enemy appears gradually during the 
game. Furthermore, the player can make use of a superpower that randomly appears during the 
game: short span invincibility. A highscore system is implemented.
